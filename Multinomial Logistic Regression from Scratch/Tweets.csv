negative,@VirginAmerica my group got their Cancelled Flightlation fees waived but I can't because my ticket is booked for 2/18? Your reps were no help either 😡
negative,@USAirways tried twice today on hold for 30 min each time. i have things to do so can't live on hold dealing w/ your customer serv failures
negative,"@AmericanAir Worst airline. You Cancelled Flight flight, don't let me know, I wait on hold 30 mins, told to enter callback for middle of the night?!!"
negative,@SouthwestAir very poor customer service thru out each of my cxl flights😔 I should've flew @Delta
negative,"@AmericanAir LGA already by the time we pulled from the flight. QQBMUG. feel free to look up how many flights we've been ""reticketed"" on."
negative,@SouthwestAir Yes but they couldn't explain the 2 hour and 45 minute hold time.
negative,@JetBlue you respond to my friend @LisaPal but you can't respond directly to me
negative,@JetBlue not one of my four flights this trip has been on time. What the he'll is your companies problem?

negative,@AmericanAir you're almost as bad as @united
negative,@SouthwestAir been all up and down the area where the pic was taken and don't see any albums.

negative,@united EVERYTIME I fly UR airline I hate you even more ! Thanks for the terrible service on flight 1071
negative,.@united being delayed 3 hours for a one hour flight is more than frustrating. I'm also unable to get a decent meal at this hour.Never again
negative,@AmericanAir Supposed to arrive at my destination tonight. American rebooks me for Wednesday? Where am I staying until then?
negative,@united nice to know that 3 hours of my time is worth $7.99. Free DirectTV for everyone! Ever hear of preventative maintenance?
negative,"@AmericanAir hah, best flight attendant response, if you not happy getting screwed over, you have other carriers.   hahahah pathetic"
negative,@USAirways tells me to talk to @AmericanAir about my delayed flights. AA tells me to talk to US. #ihatemergers
negative,@united last week we also had maintenance issues and a flat tire. Another flight last week was Cancelled Flighted. Your track record is the WORST!
negative,@USAirways just lost a faithful customer.
negative,"@united This ALWAYS happens with you guys, and it makes traveling incredibly stressful and uncomfortable. Is that good business to you?"
negative,"@USAirways question is why flight took off at all, now a friend is stuck needlessly in another city"
negative,@SouthwestAir I would die if I got tickets to #DestinationDragons and you would be invited to my funeral
negative,@united @ThisIsCoach Every time my united flight got delayed. this is a big frustration.
negative,@USAirways thank you for blowing my vacation. Couldn't get me anywhere today to make my reservation and also lost 2 bags of mine!
negative,@USAirways I keep thinking this is a massive practical joke and someone is gonna appear out of thin air and take me to Reno tonight.
negative,@USAirways @AmericanAir WHERE IS MY BAG ?#SOS ITIS BEING LOST FOR MORE THAN 24 HOURS ! #POORCUSTUMERSERVICE
negative,@USAirways I think it's a little weak sauce you have zero inflight entertainment for a 4 hour flight from Salt Lake to Philadelphia
negative,@USAirways why the hell will you not put us in a hotel when you've stranded us. Your message says mechanical issues not weather. #usairways
negative,@AmericanAir the one at 11:30am? My app still shows it as on time!
negative,@AmericanAir rebooked into a different airport. Throwing a wrench into plans 👀
negative,@united ZCC82U Cancelled Flight flight 16h in advance??? Need connect flight reschedule so the link isn't helping. Help!? Gf waited months to see me.

negative,@united not once did #US3645 leave #ORD on time this week #shameful
negative,@united UA1023 sitting on Tarmac at ORD when there are visibly gates open. Reassign our gate.
negative,@SouthwestAir - Hi Janet in customer service. I'm calling you back and have been sitting in que for 40 mins! Plz pick it up!!! #frustrated
negative,@united it's messed up to refuse to wait 10 min after united is at fault for delay but to leave early is absolutely disgusting.
negative,@united I've been waiting on my bag in IAH for 45mins.  They're only 4 freaking people on that flight waiting for bags.  Fix this!!
negative,@AmericanAir to realize your customer service leaves much to be desired and the folks handling the calls could care less...and it shows.
negative,"@united A day Late Flightr, one delayed &amp; one Cancelled Flightled flight, I'm at a gate with no seat assign. Lots of standby ppl also waiting."
negative,"@VirginAmerica is todays flight from Palm Springs, Ca to JFK in NY Cancelled Flightled?"
negative,@JetBlue letting me down in San Fran. No Media rate? What's the deal? Looks like this is the last time I fly anywhere with you.
negative,@united I did DM the details back on 02/14 when this started with phone number to reach me no reply either online or by phone
negative,"@AmericanAir Why is it ok that no-one can help me with the bag you lost on my honeymoon 3months ago, this is not responsible or professional"
negative,@USAirways problem with flight in Gainesville US Airways  5137 to CLT will miss connecting flight 5547 to IAD. When can I get another flight
negative,@JetBlue what crew? No one here is helping.
negative,@united doesn't help the 100 or more passengers that just arrived an hour Late Flight.
negative,@united Premier Gold desk changes flight. Waives fees. Gives me wrong flight. Now Jana Acosta in Salt Lake refuses the same service. Angry.
negative,@USAirways look @Delta has made the right call on CHO. Please evaluate. http://t.co/3KhGjoFgpX
negative,@United rescheduled my return flight from #Japan?  Uh why?  Trying to call #UnitedAirlines #customerservice - 45 min wait.  #fun
negative,@united have you read your own same day travel change policy?
negative,"@SouthwestAir alas, it was pretty full so we had to entertain ourselves with witty repartee ..."
negative,@USAirways rebooked me after i missed my flight..never called me and i didnt check my email.  I (cont) http://t.co/uTfDhxa8pU
negative,@USAirways Never mind that you could have told the gate I was on my way - you could delay 10 mins but not 15?
negative,"@JetBlue absolutely. The missed connection caused us to miss our ferry to Vieques. Get us to Vieques. Also, flight vouchers. #PRBound"
negative,@JetBlue really not acceptable. Just informed plane won't start. Chartering bus to take passengers to jfk.
negative,@United is the worst major US airline.  More proof: they're boarding the plane with the outside galley door open in 0 degree weather.  Wtf?
negative,@AmericanAir i was spoken 2 like I'm an idiot and that is not OK!! I don't need to deal w/ that esp after the travel experience I've had
negative,"@JetBlue Guys, really bad @JetBlue #fail . Someone better call my wife back to get this handled. 203-382-3312 while she waits on hold...."
negative,@VirginAmerica amazing to me that we can't get any cold air from the vents. #VX358 #noair #worstflightever #roasted #SFOtoBOS
negative,@USAirways understood. It simply feels as if the staff is not being entirely truthful about the situation.
negative,"@AmericanAir whenever I cheat on you it goes horribly wrong! I promise, I won't stray anymore. I'm talking about you @Delta!"
negative,@united 20 yrs of flying Continental/united exclusively I get why everyone hates you - fl1289sfo/EWR #getmeoffrhisFUCKINplane
negative,"@SouthwestAir Sure was,  with @Delta  looks like I'll make my birthday celebration after all."
negative,"@AmericanAir That's ok...You may keep my $25 and lose my bag with no info, but you no longer have my trust. Bad way to handle this."
negative,@USAirways I am in meetings in California and have no luggage!!
negative,@united hoping there is a spare a/c for 1171 tomorrow!  Have a ship to board!  The sched aircraft is delayed from previous flts.
negative,"@usairways yep, sent my bag to Philadelphia instead of Miami...I caught it...then was told my flight changed to tomorrow, wrong again #fail"
negative,@AmericanAir thanks for making this the worst flying experience ever. 4 different planes of mechanical issues and 12 hours and counting
negative,@AmericanAir between your airline and @united I've now spent three extra days traveling (DOMESTIC) and spent hundreds of dollars...
negative,@USAirways standby so far for two of us. With snow storm hitting Iowa tomorrow we could be stuck here for two days.
negative,"@USAirways - I bet you don't, but I'm the paying customer here. I know how to check for flight delays, thank you."
negative,"@SouthwestAir Hello remaining credits on your account will be refunded back to your credit card, when you choose a lower price flight?"
negative,@AmericanAir I have been trying to get through to someone about my Cancelled Flightled flight tomorrow for over 4 hours.
negative,@united so who does handle bag issues? And why wouldn't you put me onto them in the first place?
negative,@USAirways yeah you guys just told me to call the website that I booked from. I booked on your website. UNACCEPTABLE
negative,@USAirways you are the worst.
negative,@USAirways well then that is a horrible flaw in your system. 2 hours in the past day I've wasted. I've got a job &amp; family this is crazy
negative,@AmericanAir 4 open kiosks for priority with no line and only 4 open for main check in for ~80-100 ppl
negative,"@SouthwestAir how is tkt in the A grp for a cxld flight gets stuck at the back of the Cs when your site, phone and agents took 1h to rebook"
negative,@AmericanAir HELP! Attempting to Cancelled Flight a flight but can't get thru 800 number. Call gets dropped when saying Agent. flight is 2/24.
negative,@united call wait times are over 20 minutes and airport wait times are longer
negative,"@USAirways why aren't twitter and reservations connected? What do people want? Reservations, duh?!?!"
negative,@SouthwestAir Your hold music needs 2 be fixed:certain tracks have loud phone button mashing tones in them.Estimated wait time would help 2.
negative,"@SouthwestAir love how ""friendly"" your staff is when asking for updates on delayed flights causing missed connections. #horribleattitudes"
negative,@AmericanAir thanks for a Cancelled Flightled flight then a delayed flight and NOT telling us More missed work More $ on hotel #WorstCustomerService
negative,@JetBlue quick ? Why is a person traveling w  a mosaic not get the green tag? Doesn't make sense I end up waitin 4 my sons bag anyway :/
negative,@USAirways That's clever. Its clear you need more agents. 94 min hold and counting. Flex workforces are highly possible in 2015
negative,@USAirways @AmericanAir need to check candy w working flight 449 iah to phx on usairways she is the reason I always choose @Delta #rude
negative,@USAirways so far I've gotten six different answers
negative,@USAirways: I experienced what defines customer service on #FLT1999. A flight attendant willing to follow up with a passenger on bag charges
negative,@AmericanAir there's a direct from Miami w a seat but u rebooked niece Tuesday. Can't get through on phones? #customerservicefail
negative,@USAirways you gladly take the loyal customer's money but when you cause an inconvenience you do nothing to help fix the problem you caused.
negative,@USAirways @AshleyKAtherton Over an hour on hold so far
negative,@united customers aren't dumb. These revenue based programs will hurt everyone. Not gonna save money like you think
negative,@AmericanAir That what I hoped - contacted them 3 wks ago about this but they have not responded and still issued in US funds. #frustrated
negative,"@USAirways Another twist in the plot. Took off from Miami, then had to return due to a unsecured cargo door. most stressful vacation ever."
negative,@united on 768 to Logan - boarding gong show due to lax carry on enforcement. Bins full of coats = no room for bags. U need a better system!
negative,@AmericanAir is there another line I can call when I am on hold for 5 hours? Also how can I get compensated for this loss of time and money?
negative,@AmericanAir. For two days now I have been trying to reach #AmericanAirlines customer service to change my flight.
negative,@USAirways can I at least get a response?  I tried the gate person (sent me the wrong way to cust srvc ) Cust Srvc (when I found them)
negative,@united also didn't ice the frozen metal walkway. Wasted 40 minutes because no one knew how to do simple jobs.
negative,@united I'm constantly having challenges with upgrades &amp; charges. In order to prevent DVT I have to pay an addtl $180 http://t.co/xC6jQ70r7B
negative,@united &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;------- shoddy customer service. Of no use whatsoever. #unitedairline
negative,@united thanks for making everyone wait in the dark for an hour while Newark tries to figure out which gate to go to. #incompetence
negative,@USAirways You guys are screwing up my trip. Thanks for nothing. #lazy
negative,"@AmericanAir Thx, someone picked up after 45 minutes"

negative,"@USAirways #not happy, wife 40th Bday trip. would like to be fully compensated for both flights"
negative,@AmericanAir usually raving about the service to LAX. Your nbr1 and helper can't figure out how to hang a coat and serve a drink. 6F
negative,@JetBlue just a very rude rep while trying to book family vacation using trvl credit. on phone w/ new rep now who is being very helpful
negative,"@AmericanAir once again flying AA4285, once again 60+ min delay because of mechanical issues. Perhaps you should consider maintenance?"

negative,. @USAirways It's been Cancelled Flighted. Your SM response is slow.
negative,@united ua1673 still waiting! Supposed to depart 9:08
negative,@JetBlue I am less concerned about the delay than I am about not being notified until I looked at the board that my flight was delayed
negative,@JetBlue is blaming @TSA for flight 584 luggage debacle!  #luggagegate
negative,@AmericanAir I like the call back system. But thought you'd like to know it's not working well. I received three calls but there's no audio.
negative,@AmericanAir The word failure means: an act or instance of failing or proving unsuccessful; lack of success nonperformance of something due.

negative,@AmericanAir they will just say dumb things to beat around the bush ! If you're flight Cancelled Flightled be prepared for no compassion from them
negative,@AmericanAir is that something the crew on the current leg can request of the gate team on the next leg?
negative,"@USAirways They don't stand alone for me, I bought tix based on USAir confirmed flight. What good is confirmation if you change it anyway?"

negative,@USAirways I hope flight 1855 is not being delayed because flight attendant didn't come to work! #nobackup

negative,@united now maintenance issues with flight 5639 and more issues with passengers that will miss connections needing to get off
negative,@AmericanAir I do not need an apology. I need you to fix it in a competent manner.
negative,@AmericanAir I understand the weather issue but you can't expect passengers to wait 24 hours inside airports for whatever reason. Outrageous
negative,@USAirways something is wrong with your phone system if you call someone and don't play the recorded flight notification. Is US643 Late Flight?
negative,"@united No. SATO rebooked me. Just upset that my travel office had to fix this, and you couldn't."

negative,"@JetBlue Felt a bit like they were adding insult to injury, since we'll be in terminal 5 for seven hours until the next flight :/"

negative,@united 3 hours of sitting in the plane that hasn't left the Gate yet. 6 more hours of actual flying left.
negative,"@AmericanAir Yes, it says my reservation cannot be retrieved at this time. Also I never got an email from AA saying my flight was Cancelled Flightled."

negative,@united its funny how none of ur tweets back are helpful what I want is to read 'ya we'll change that so our customers get better service'
negative,"@SouthwestAir My flight was 952, leaving las vegas at 5:40pm, arriving at CHI-MID at 11:00 pm."
negative,"@USAirways due to your expensive change fees either. Out of all the airlines, we chose yours, all do you could screw us. STRANDED!! No help!"
negative,@united Good luck with the no-enertainment-on-6-hour-flights strategy. Innovation at work. Hello @jetblue http://t.co/HI76BOavXY
negative,"@SouthwestAir , please explain to me why every other flight to Dallas is going out today except the 6:35 pm?????"
negative,@USAirways Decided to be a good sport and give you guys another shot. Flight delayed. Again.
negative,@AmericanAir yes but you did manage to lose two of our bags. Horrendous airline.
negative,"@AmericanAir been a very long day in Philly...12:13pm flt to ORD Cancelled Flighted with NO notice, no message, no email.  NOT NICE FOR WE PLATINUMS."
negative,@united UA1740. 4.5 hr mechanical delay all I get is $50 voucher? Will tweet when I book next trip not on UA.
negative,i wish i was flying @USAirways ... @JetBlue Cancelled Flightled our flights tomorrow and never notified us #FlyUS #Ripoff
negative,"@united you realize you've said this already. At least last time you asked if I needed ""help"""
negative,"@VirginAmerica mood lighting on point🙌 Reclining my seat, kickin up my feet💤"
negative,"@USAirways between 3 of us, it is costing over $1000 to get home TODAY for no reason... Where do I send my receipts to be reimbursed?"
negative,@USAirways my frustrations are the result of multiple experiences Late Flightly. Currently lost luggage. I want to talk to a real person.
negative,"@USAirways I been sitting on this plane for 40 minutes, and they are saying another 15 minutes something about paper work. This sucks !!"
negative,"@USAirways : Was on flight 2046 BOS-CLT on 2/22, awful experience, exit row seat was so narrow that I could not move my legs! Unacceptable."
negative,@JetBlue u now have my gears grinding. The JFK baggage office told me I need to bring the bag back right now if not they will close my claim
negative,@AmericanAir 3 months of straight travel ahead. Time to find new airline.
negative,@united thanks ^mr i got rebooked already but I lost my first class seat. Such is life.
negative,@JetBlue flight attendant was hesitant to give me more baby sized cookies
negative,@AmericanAir I even went to ticket counter and got no help
negative,@united but it's hard to stay upset at someone when they at least TRY to show remorse.
negative,@united a report was filed with the airport police on 11th and 12th February-I have the police case number if required
negative,@AmericanAir so we've now been driving across DFW for over 90mins. That's half fucking way to Texarkana! #shouldhavedriven
negative,@AmericanAir @kaps12 this is an international airline that experienced record profits last quarter. But they can't staff a call center
negative,@united now sitting on the tarmac for a half hour after landing because your jetway is broken. #2daysofunitedfailures #1thingafteranother
negative,@United give me a direct number I can call regarding my lost baggage immediately.
negative,@USAirways I will NEVER fly us airways or american again and I will share this nightmare of a story to all the many others we know who fly
negative,@AmericanAir  your customer service is deplorable. I am disgusted in your company and the ignorant people on the phones for lost baggage.
negative,@AmericanAir am on hold for the 2nd time today. Need help with confirming the new flights you arranged for me. Can you expedite this?
negative,"@AmericanAir also the problem is not calling us at all. Other airlines send an automatic call and email, and they rebook as a courtesy."
negative,@united note: they are traveling w 2yr old. Unreal
negative,@AmericanAir - AA1344 Cancelled Flighted on 2.23 - rebooked on us air 623/544 on 2.24. Has to be a nonstop on 2.24 for us (2)?
negative,@USAirways They're also saying the CLT flights are delayed but you're not showing it in your system which makes it impossible to figure out
negative,@JetBlue u suck Big Donkey Balls!

negative,@USAirways so I was just told I was coded as an upgrade... I clearly purchased this seat with my miles and refuse to downgrade. #ripoff
negative,"@USAirways First the pilot was Late Flight, now it's maintenance. This is EXACTLY what happened two weeks ago. Unacceptable."
negative,@USAirways Cool. Now @SweetingR has been told you can't re-route his bags after he was told to leave them last night. He needs them to race.
negative,@SouthwestAir not letting me DM. # is FSZ4YO

negative,@JetBlue @ZKatcher @bretharold does it look like to we talked to customer service? http://t.co/vYUAnh4Iqr

negative,"@SouthwestAir my bag was lost, and according to the rep they don't even know where it is, Please help."
negative,@united why no preferred security line anymore. My TSA pre-check didn't pull on my @SilverAirways partner flight! #Platinum #spoiled
negative,@USAirways 40 minutes to put my TSA number in… 40 mins… and stop holding people hostage with requiring a dividends miles acct. @tsa
negative,@united - Thanks. Formed submitted. I'm not betting someone would be honest enough to turn it in though...
negative,@USAirways it was your fault the flight was delayed to begin with. I shouldn't have to check my bag if there's a bunch of space
negative,@united just landed. Might want to check flight 304 plane from Houston. That sound was during takeoff &amp; landing http://t.co/QKquRagGoO
negative,@AmericanAir we have posted your response on facebook for everyone to see people are appalled by your lack of concern
negative,@JetBlue DONT LOSE MY LUGGAGE!!!
negative,"@USAirways we are on the 2pm flight FLL to PHL and then connection to MAN. However, with the delays we might miss it. Can we go earlier?"
negative,@USAirways any update on this flight?It's more than three hours delayed. Thank you.
negative,@AmericanAir thx for the apology.   A commitment to fix your broken system would be better.  Actually fixing it would be better still.
negative,"@united Flight is awful only one lavatory functioning, and people lining up, bumping, etc. because can't use 1st class bathroom. Ridiculous"
negative,@SouthwestAir where is the great customer service I have come to know/expect; you LUV dropped by EB check in and no help in sight!

negative,@united once again your lack of customer service astounds me! You are the worst airline in the history of airlines! Train your staff!
negative,@united what I don't understand isn't flight that I paid premium for getting Cancelled Flighted and the best you can do is next available flight...
negative,@SouthwestAir you're giving everyone tix for #DestinationDragons except for me and it's during my birthday!!!!
negative,@united what's a good number to call to speak with someone about how you can fix what you did to 50 people and their luggage on Saturday?
negative,"@JetBlue  I shouldn't have to find them, they should tell us. I've flown Jet Blue since your first month. The experience isn't what it was."
negative,"@VirginAmerica Never had a bad experience before, but this one took the cake. Now extortion for carry on items as well?"

negative,@SouthwestAir why did you book my hotel twice?!?! Ahhhhh
negative,@AmericanAir Any info for Cancelled Flightled flight 1046 tomorrow morning out of DFW? Can't get calls through to speak with anyone.
negative,@USAirways with such disrespect I cannot even begin to explain. He has an issue with women and he literally yelled at me and pulled me off
negative,@JetBlue that is a stock response. Delays not as frustrating as poor cust serv &amp; being told by 3 ppl to wait &amp; they'd come back but did not.
negative,"@USAirways where's my bag?  You called at noon promising it today, would like an update like your website promises.  I need that bag!"
negative,@USAirways it was supposed to be a carry on and in Pittsburgh  coming to Boston it was a carry on
negative,@united I'm strongly considering taking my business elsewhere. #UnitedAirlines
negative,"@JetBlue If that was the case, why did your alert arrive so Late Flight? Four-hour delay? Don't buy it."
negative,"@united troubling news, time to raise the bar on legroom! http://t.co/nmbHNGnMkI"
negative,"@united your unhelpful team? Sure I did. I'm in Bangkok, my bag in Chicago. Are u going to pay for my accommodation s until my bag arrives??"
negative,@united are my bags here yet?  They were at Palm Springs airport.  I was at LAX.  How come I beat my bags here.
negative,"@united sure, but 8 different texts changing time &amp; gate (especially locations across the entire concourse). That just seemed a little off."
negative,@AmericanAir @RLDelahunty record l#oaaret got email we couldn't get rescheduled on another flight but don't know if flight is Cancelled Flightled
negative,@SouthwestAir way to fuck up and lose @c_istudios bags. My husband has no warm clothes and no equipment. #youdidit #notcool
negative,@united ORD Gate C25 and Flt 619-  remember when customers were valuable? Is it so hard to be nice to someone lugging a guitar &amp; carryons ?
negative,@USAirways your team was just terrifyingly rude to a young mother &amp; her baby trying to check in to a flight from PHX to JWA. Help her out.
negative,"@USAirways now I am on flight to FLL, and told to take a train back to PBI to get my car. There are no trains to PBI!"
negative,@SouthwestAir why are you literally the worst?
negative,@USAirways how do I get you to stop sending me emails about my ex boyfriends account? I don't care how many points he has! He only has
negative,@united broke my suitcase &amp; refuses to give me a repair estimate. http://t.co/zOUOwgv3Q6
negative,"@USAirways after a grt flight to PHX last week,  tonight was terrible. 2.5 hours taxing and you give us water and crackers to compensate."
negative,"@united Thank you for wasting my time &amp; money. Not only will I now arrive 5 hours Late Flight to my destination, but..."
negative,@AmericanAir @Rizzilient I booked tickets using miles and need to change the dates.  Have been trying to get to an advantage rep 4 two days
negative,"@AmericanAir Flight Cancelled Flightled, website refers to 1-800#, the 1-800# hangs up on me. Not auto-rebooked. Really? Horrible company."
negative,@USAirways Feeling helpless at Tanpa airport. How can I talk to someone. Flight delayed 4 times. Need help. Missed connections will be prob
negative,@JetBlue well I'm glad I got up at 5 am so I can sit in an airport.  No place else I'd rather be (not)
negative,@USAirways Your customer service line keeps telling me call back Late Flightr and disconnects. How can I talk to someone about my flight?
negative,@united WHAT?! Y'all have zero concept of customer service. Oh...and now my connection is delayed too!
negative,@USAirways is the 7th circle of hell right after the dmv. #noshadetothedmv
negative,@USAirways spent 1.5 hours in line trying to get on a flight home tonight only for it to be Cancelled Flightled an hour Late Flightr. Not even snowing at DCA
negative,@AmericanAir I tried several times to select seats. The only ones ever available would've cost me $30 extra per seat.
negative,@JetBlue - worst view for an athlete; watching your team from the front seat of the chase van #nogearnotraining
negative,"@united...lies lies lies....still sitting at the gate, have not moved an inch http://t.co/LulGnwEfFH"
negative,@united My feedback and concerns via your site aren’t going to improve my poor airport experiences.
negative,"@SouthwestAir I appreciate the response, but the constant changing of the flight time is frustrating to say the least. #toughtomakeplans"
negative,"@united See? We were told repeatedly that the pilot was Late Flight and kept getting Late Flightr.  After we boarded, there was a defibrillator issue."
negative,@USAirways @AmericanAir how is it possible that someone is drunk they bring a wheelchair for them but you keep serving them
negative,@AmericanAir @superyan I did not get any compensation after Cancelled Flighting my departure TWICE and made me missed my own wedding.
negative,@AmericanAir thanks for the canned reply.
negative,"@united how can you not know, after two hours of us sitting on the plane with no bags off loaded, the planes weight?!"

negative,@united @staralliance how can I book reward travel in August?? Everything is blacked out.
negative,@united Missed KTM flight due to ur Cancelled Flightlation. Mike supervisor disgusting.  Now day Late Flight. No apology or upgrade offer to LHR from ORD???
negative,@USAirways -doing best??? Think not. Lousy way to run an airline. Why no online way to connect? You be on hold for 2hrs &amp; then zip
negative,"@USAirways sorry, I meant flight 4420, which was supposed to depart at 5:00, now says 6:30. What is the issue?"
negative,@AmericanAir and let FLT 2350 know I'm coming / gate crew have yet to arrive to let us off FLT 5350 #DFW
negative,@SouthwestAir Does anyone ever answer your phone? #poor
negative,@AmericanAir AA 1657 was also over an hour Late Flight to depart Ohare and now we have no luggage. Not happy standing in a long line at baggage svc

negative,@AmericanAir Delayed: AA3186 - Missed due to delay: AA3186 - New flight now delayed: AA2401
negative,@united 24 hrs since flight landed and ZERO info on my missing bag? rough ETA would be hugely helpful + restore some confidence
negative,"@USAirways 3+ hours on hold... oh, wait, for less than 5 minutes a useless CSR talked to me and put me back on hold for the last 30 minutes."
negative,@united My credit card was charged on the transaction when I was told it would not be. If the charge goes through I will be contacting you.
negative,@AmericanAir hi my flight to DFW 2463 was Cancelled Flightled tonight. Called in and left my number for call back it's been 3hrs please help.
negative,@united I work in customer support- extremely saddened United won't waive change fee for flights I had to Cancelled Flight due to east coast storms.
negative,@united Can we get Any (free) upgrade because all the problems we've had? Our reservation is MKWLKR.
negative,"@united passengers seated, crew ready #WheresThePilot? Flt1088 from ORD. Hope he isn't at the bar."
negative,@USAirways First class no snack basket was catered so drinks only No preflight drink or coathanging 1st drink service 50 min after take off
negative,@united Airline SUCKS! Customer Service SUCKS! NO courtesy! Incompetent - passengers do NOT matter- Bet the CEO is just doing fine though!
negative,@JetBlue what gives? Delayed over 2 hours at MCO to JFK. Every time!
negative,@JetBlue actually they said the fraud issue was never resolved. but why then did they issue me a new ticket of the phone?
negative,@SouthwestAir you have let me down! #oversold #earlybirdmeansnothing
negative,@JetBlue someone is here but has no info smh one bag came off  and then nothing
negative,@SouthwestAir Conf #8Q6MFD Finally got through &amp; told the flight was completely booked.  That would have been better info than advise 2 call

negative,@USAirways flight from Bhm delayed 5hrs! Connect flgt left us in clt at a motel
negative,@united at this point I made it home on my own.
negative,"@united I find this text funny, considering we are still sitting here because 2 seats need to be changed out. http://t.co/LoLuWfCi11"
negative,@VirginAmerica Sent a couple messages to the email you provided but to no avail. Will try again next year. Cheers.
negative,"@USAirways - why can't the gate agent on flight #759 provide an update? Seriously, this is ridiculous how long people have been waiting"
negative,@united airlines: you kidding? Bagage lost this morning from ny to Washington and still no trace? #badservice
negative,@united so glad I've been waiting for 1 hour and 15 minutes and Ive been transferred 3 times without resolving anything. Worst service ever.
negative,“@united: @RobCNYC See information on our boarding process: http://t.co/gBIw9ugFNm ^KP”. I get group 1&amp;2. Just no reason on 3/5.
negative,@USAirways have done that. Sadly no flight from CLT has gotten to IND today and we head back to Tampa tmrw.
negative,"“@AmericanAir: @Andrew_Wasila We're sorry you were uncomfortable, Andrew. What can we do for you?” SMA"
negative,@united 4595. We are now going back to the gate b/c of something overheating after sitting out here for 3+ hours.Love United but this stinks
negative,"@USAirways Hey, my bag was damaged flying with you yesterday. What can I do?"
negative,@united More concerned that you close a club I paid alot for at 10.  Last flight 11:15p.  The construction going on is very inconvenient.
negative,@USAirways you used to have an evening flight DCA-DSM and an early AM return. Now it's middle of the work day for both. Inconvenient.
negative,@JetBlue remember - I'm very doubtful and not very hopeful :(
negative,@USAirways I do but the real ? Is why your staff can behave offensively. Flight 699. Please look into it. Message me if you want particulars
negative,"@AmericanAir Right. But more than two hours Late Flight, and it seems due to poor communication, which sounded like it was annoying on-plane staff"
negative,@United We've been waiting on tarmac for &gt;1hr because apparently UA1116 is overweight &amp; we returned to gate. #WTF #fb
negative,@USAirways pretty upset I drove from Philly to MHtT still no info on my bags. What's the deal!
negative,@united no they aren't - I just called to check. #WORSTCUSTOMERSERVICE
negative,@SouthwestAir i have asked Lindsey to call me instead of DM like a schoolgirl but so far no call   Getting tired of typing little notes
negative,@united I think problem resolution should be decided on your end. Especially if you'd like me to continue flying your airline.
negative,"@djevolutionhd As an EP who travels 125K+ miles a yr with @AmericanAir , I would expect more from them than this horrible travel experience"
negative,@SouthwestAir Your onboard wifi is so bad it's taking me 20 minutes to send this tweet.  Working is off the table. #disappointed
negative,"@USAirways not going as planned is an understatement. My flight was just changed AGAIN. If it weren't for a family emergency, I'd Cancelled Flight."
negative,"@USAirways  A few years ago I lost over 50,000 miles bc I was physically unable to fly during the period.  I submitted a doctor's note."
negative,@USAirways what is going on with the computers? Why is my flight grounded? Why does your airline suck so much? #UnansweredQuestions
negative,@USAirways flight 4524  first a 2 hour wait for a deadhead crew  then deadhead crew takes overhead bin space paying customers annoyed
negative,@united correct date is 2/11/15!

negative,@AmericanAir the pilot her and another flight attendant left walking away laughing.  Just wow

negative,@AmericanAir … Been trying to book a whole new flight since 2 hours!! what is wrong with your website?
negative,@AmericanAir My wife &amp; infant daughter are on AA3195 ABI-DFW. En route but delayed. Can y’all hold AA1458 to RDU so they can connect?
negative,@AmericanAir that's the number I called -it wouldn't let me speak to an agent because of the issues with weather today
negative,@AmericanAir Flight Cancelled Flighted 2nd time. Can't reach agent to reschedule. Can you call me?
negative,@united should contact me and the others on my flight who can't get their website to work. None of our info is valid! http://t.co/3zpJr7kWbk
negative,@SouthwestAir nbd I was able to figure out a workaround. Just wanted to help. Got my bags less than 24 hours Late Flightr. Muchas grassy ass.
negative,@JetBlue why haven't you allowed for flight changes into the NY area airports tonight?  Everyone is saying travel is treacherous.
negative,@USAirways How can I speak to a human? Need 2 find bag delayed 2/21. Website and 800 # are telling me 2 different things! Got hung up on 2x
negative,@AmericanAir is the company from hell with NO consideration for customers that give it hundreds of millions of dollars per year #SMH
negative,@JetBlue your app needs updating. Says my flight is on time when we are well past boarding time with 2hr delay http://t.co/BTvpxTZJu0
negative,@SouthwestAir it keeps saying that mobile boarding passes are unavailable despite having checked in and everything
negative,"@USAirways I'm on vacation, This is the LAST thing I want to be doing. Is anyone even answering the phone?"
negative,@VirginAmerica already contacted Central Baggage &amp; sent DM. @RenttheRunway is charging me for the dress that was in the lost suitcase #help
negative,@USAirways stuck on Tarmac for hour an a half and told longer to go and no hotels available when we land in Phoenix #unacceptable #unhappy
negative,@USAirways sat on the ramp for 45 min and missed my connection. No one seems to concerned at usairways.
negative,@AmericanAir makes some small improvements and retains their program they win all. They keep the crappy food and change advantage they lose
negative,"@united Supposedly, they're out for delivery. I'll believe it when I see it."
negative,@united You are a F&amp;$KING joke. Your customer service is woeful. If your staff tell a passenger that they will do something do it!
negative,@JetBlue not making a great first impression on my first flight. 20 minutes before boarding and the gate agent still can't assign me a seat?
negative,@USAirways hey folks where do you hide luggage when you Cancelled Flight a flight! You have 100 very angry people with no luggage
negative,@JetBlue being told JFK had a 5 hour delay this AM which is reason for my delay now. It can't be that hard to notify with 12 hours notice
negative,@USAirways we've (flight 4443) been sitting on the tarmac of dca for a while now waiting on a gate. Can we just use another gate?
negative,@AmericanAir no one met flight 1081 to LAX to tell passengers where to go or what flights they were rebooked on #badmgmt #AmericanAirlines
negative,@united that guy really has no customer service clue.Could have spent effort clearing bins for rollerboards instead of art projects in mine!
negative,@united you guys suck. You delay flights but can't hold the connectors 10 minutes??? #WorstAirlineEver
negative,@SouthwestAir wifi on my plane but I gotta pay for it? Help your broke homegirl out✈️📱
negative,@united i emailed the customer care via the website form. After a long wait Rachelle resolved my issue. But I'm still irritated w/ united.
negative,:( RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/ncguZDgDaQ
negative,@SouthwestAir how does your pre boarding process work? Basically anyone who doesn't want to wait their turn can get a slip?
negative,@AmericanAir stuck at gate Miami to JFK flight 1510. Are we going to get out of here tonight? Very frustrating
negative,@SouthwestAir   I hate evolved seating. knees in the seat pocket http://t.co/forNpF69Ky
negative,@SouthwestAir Weather seriously cannot even be the only excuse at this point because it was awful service in the summer too. Over it.
negative,@USAirways you guys Cancelled Flightled two of my flights yesterday and I checked the bag to Huntsville and it went missing in Philly.
negative,"@AmericanAir Hello, question, How many balloons do you think it will take to life up one of your planes?"
negative,"@united yes please! I am newly married and trying to update my last name on a preexisting international flight! It seems so easy, but..."
negative,@AmericanAir what's done is done. Not much you can do at this point. Trip is already over.
negative,@united you board a 630a flight and then Cancelled Flight it because it doesn't have a pilot?  Now I miss my meeting Atlanta because someone slept in?
negative,@united ...just called and lady at your overseas call center said she saw no note. I explained the situation...again...
negative,@AmericanAir so you fail again flight to rdu sitting waiting on flight attendants. your logistics are not good
negative,"@AmericanAir when you strand someone in a city without luggage you would think AA would want to earn your business, but guess not?"
negative,@USAirways flight 645 to Phoenix deboards passengers going to Salt Lake City because they can't resolve a simple bathroom issue. #fail
negative,@SouthwestAir @jparkermastin  customer service has been very passive in their response. Disappointed. I have only flown SW but am rethinking
negative,@USAirways 4 hrs and counting today alone... like I don't have other things to accomplish today than to just keep holding!!!
negative,"@SouthwestAir you're right, I do. I've been traveling all day and you guys dropped the ball. Making for a long night."
negative,@united - flight 1114. Unfortunately this isn't an isoLate Flightd incident. I haven't waited less than 20min in years
negative,@USAirways @PHLAirport this is the reason I avoid @PHLAirport and @USAirways like the plague. Glad to see this merger is working well. #dumb
negative,@USAirways depart from where? It departed PHX and was due to land at DCA around 8pm.
negative,"@USAirways I listed my baggage claim number.  Have them call me, my number is on the ticket.  I had to use Lady Speed Stick this morning."
negative,@JetBlue Any option for luggage assistance on the ground at HPN? Flight 2168 delayed 2+ hours &amp; we will have 2 sleeping kids when we land
negative,"@SouthwestAir Was on hold for 2 hours before you disconnected me after my flight was Cancelled Flightled. Swell company, you."
negative,@JetBlue I don't know- no one would tell me where they were coming from - I would guess so as that's where we had all the changes to flights
negative,@USAirways your chairmans phone is down. what other number can i use?
negative,@USAirways let's say it's directly correLate Flightd to the chance of a replacement case. I know which would cost the airline less!
negative,"@united #customerservice at @Dulles_Airport could not be worse. I get the bad weather, but this is awful."
negative,@united Still waiting on our bag! Never got delivered yesterday. Can't reach a real person for help. Sending DM with ref number.
negative,@USAirways Flt 4609 landed over half an hour ago. Not a single bag yet on the baggage claim. Hate you so much right now.
negative,@united quality work going on here. http://t.co/9xbO5daKaK
negative,@united I interviewed yesterday as a flight attendant I was the last person the recruiter said they lost my file n came back to interview me
negative,@AmericanAir thnkx bt dont help now we will need to go WAY out of OUR way to get where we NEED to be for the $ u charge this sux #neveragain
negative,@united flight 1219. My frustration boiled over after dealing with attendant. Her attitude was ridiculous.
negative,"@united Nice ""partners"" you have. The delays keep increasing every 20 min @FtLauderdaleSun @orlandosentinel http://t.co/1AtEafnC6R"
negative,"@united @campilley hahaha. If they weren't an American company, i would say this was great sarcasm!!"
negative,@JetBlue Something to think about when you are dealing with PEOPLE!!!!!  Just wrong.  No excuses. Figure it out &amp; expect the unexpected
negative,"@united Late Flight to Denver, Late Flight to Newark...let's not even get into the disaster that was checking bags. Unacceptable."
negative,@USAirways it would be nice to just pull up to the gate. Still sitting here
negative,@united did I mention one bag is an infant car seat &amp; we've been stuck with yr poor replacement on icy mtn roads
negative,@united hard to believe since your staff @ SFO checked them under someone by the name of #ritacomo who flew to EWR the same day.
negative,"@JetBlue Token $75.00 Goodwill Voucher for passengers stuck on flight 136 from Phoenix today. 3 hour mark. How about a $27,000 per passenger"
negative,@united Hate when I get bumped out of the seat I've selected (&amp; empty row) and moved to another seat (non-empty). #1K #flt803 #nonupgrade!
negative,"@AmericanAir while I'm sensitive to this fact, I don't believe that warrants poor service. A little help &amp; compassion goes a long way."
negative,@USAirways So you understand why I'm resorting to Twitter: No help available at  gate while this occurred or by phone afterward.
negative,@AmericanAir so what are you going to do for me since I can't take the option you gave me. What type of refund will you do for me?
negative,@united is a money sucking airline with terrible terrible customer service
negative,@SouthwestAir I would still have my companion pass if your ridiculous airline hadn't stopped partnering with Hilton Hotels - GENIUS!!!

negative,@united 8h flight without a working screen for me and my friend and not possible to move to another place #unitedfails#worsttripofmylife
negative,"@AmericanAir Cancelled Flighted flights, now I'm rerouted and have over 12 hrs of travel but you will bump paying customers for non revs. #custserv"
negative,@SouthwestAir same here. Would appreciate a follow so I can DM my info to figure out what I am supposed to do.
negative,"@united cross country flight SFO&gt;BOS. No wifi, not even a can of soda and this quality inflight entertainment #sad http://t.co/xhlc30MTfF"
negative,@AmericanAir your customer service is inferior to that of a nationalized third world nation's airline. Get it together.
negative,@SouthwestAir this was the 3rd Cancelled Flightlation in 2 days due to weather in Nashville. 3 trips to the airport. Each time communicated Late Flight by SW
negative,@VirginAmerica Another delayed flight? #likingyoulessandless
negative,@USAirways @AmericanAir so does that mean @AmericanAir that you might care about my sister be assaulted on one of your flights

negative,"@VirginAmerica the CSS on your site is a 404 right now, please fix. Site unusable."
negative,@AmericanAir ok. There is no one at the airport that is helping us. Another customer got told the flight isn't leaving till 1220
negative,@USAirways no word on delay reasons @LGB but Twitter is aflame with flight tracking computer crash. Rumors. True or Not?
negative,@JetBlue Why not deal with that while the plane's on the ground instead of diverting the plane &amp; adding 2 hrs to the flight?
negative,@AmericanAir none of your sample itineraries can actually be booked http://t.co/mF7rABGn8a Every last leg back to US says invalid
negative,"@united the we got into the gate at IAH on time and have given our seats and closed the flight. If you know people is arriving, have to wait"
negative,"@united I'm trying to get to my final destination, we need compensation. Just about 2hrs of personal time wasted."

negative,@VirginAmerica Do you guys know your check-in links from emails are broken? http://t.co/2npXB6oBMr
negative,"@SouthwestAir For example, can't pay 4 hotel &amp; food? Or transport to alternate city we are flying from? Or give clear record of alt flight?"
negative,@JetBlue Thanks. So the delay was the result of scheduling issues more than weather reLate Flightd problems?
negative,@USAirways where's our luggage? Been waiting more than an hour! Flight 2118.
negative,@USAirways @AmericanAir According to your costumer support your website is holding my money hostage and you cant do anything about it..
negative,@USAirways our flight was rebooked with you and we want to change our seats or upgrade to 1st class. Can you help? Phones are down.
negative,@USAirways is charging me $200 to NOT take my flight. Lol. That is the last time I fly with them.

negative,"@JetBlue after applying my new tag, she left my bag on the ground rather than loading on the conveyer belt..I had to walk back 50 yards"
negative,@SouthwestAir not yet! Supposed to get it early evening tonight. Don't want to have to go to the store and buy new necessities.

negative,@united never flying with you guys ever again. The customer service is piss poor at best.
negative,"@SouthwestAir why would I want to when the last time I did, you screwed me out of my early boarding that I PAID FOR."

negative,@USAirways yes but again valuable time has been lost
negative,@united Flight delayed 40 minutes in ORD because plane didn’t have all the food. That should be fixed in the future. It’s a dumb delay.
negative,"@SouthwestAir yeah, all 4 are rebooked for tomorrow AM. Hoping the 3rd time is a charm for no Cancelled Flightled flights!"
negative,"@SouthwestAir Was going for the weekend for friend's birthday, so no point in reFlight Booking Problems."

negative,"@JetBlue looks like their inflatable car seats got left on the plane, so I guess they'll be back sometime!! #savethoseseats"
negative,@united not yet. I complained about the guy who checked my luggage in as he was throwing the bags around. Unfortunate coincidence I hope?
negative,"@USAirways I have now called 12 times in the last three days. That's unacceptable. I'm willing to wait on hold, but that's not an option."

negative,@SouthwestAir it eventually arrived. just seemed really slow. :)

negative,"@USAirways overloads small plane with extra baggage and then. Has to take them off... Poor execution #4435, 75 minute delay..."
negative,@USAirways 45 min hold time then a hang up by Manager Mike in dividend miles dept. tough to justify sticking with the Us air CC and status.
negative,@USAirways You will be hearing a lot more from me instead of your feedback when I get back home.
negative,"@AmericanAir i ordered it as i always do. But on a 9hour flight delayed for 4 hours, it was worse than ever before when you forgot my meal."
negative,@AmericanAir is your website down? I haven't been able to check in to my flight all morning.
negative,@united I didn't have time to take my wet clothes/suit back to the airport and wasn't going to pay for another cab to do so.
negative,@united It's a shame choosing #United may be the difference between reuniting with aging friends and never seeing them again #PoorService
negative,"@AmericanAir this is pathetic customer service. Why have bag tags, barcodes and computers if your response is, ""not yet located""?"
negative,@AmericanAir extra night we have to stay in San Juan now. How can I check on that?
negative,"@USAirways worst airline ever....left without luggage for 7 days, submit $700 expenses and they offer a refund of $297? #badservice"

negative,@USAirways told to work it out ourselves #joke #fail

negative,@USAirways how long for a reply
negative,"@united 2.5 hour delay, misplaced bag, poor communication, and the worse: unsympathetic, confrontational gate agent. Not cool!!!"
negative,@SouthwestAir please PM me the number where I can lodge formal complaints. Thx
negative,@AmericanAir at 5 am and have no clue if we have a place to stay or not
negative,@AmericanAir Hands down the worst airline to travel with. Really really fucking bad.
negative,@VirginAmerica how come you don't have an iPhone app? Still using and making me waste paper.
negative,"@AmericanAir Hey you Cancelled Flightled my flight, and I can't get someone on the phone to rebook (2 hour wait minimum). Can I get some service?"
negative,"@USAirways not happy w/ app Late Flightly. Last time I flew wouldn't let me check in, This time I checked in went on Late Flightr says I never checked in"
negative,@SouthwestAir 2 bags fly free!  So what's with all the carry-on's? #packingayak @BrianReganComic
negative,@united searched for mileage tickets to BOM couldn't find a single one is saver awards - I see how you play.  Earn miles but can't use them.
negative,@united @UnitedAppeals @gg8929 What kind of hypocrisy is that? Only Cancelled Flightling tickets with bad exchange rate if in your advantage #united
negative,@USAirways I have a story for you. It starts with a two hour delayed flight that makes me miss my connection in Miami.
negative,@united So disappointed in the service and the level of staff communication. Such a bummer.

negative,@united 1k member broken seat back broken tv broken light lost bag  gee thnx. UA922 awesome job
negative,@USAirways It's not double booked. I spoke with CS and we've got a plan to fix this. It's still an amateur mistake that should never happen.
negative,@SouthwestAir #delayed again! You're killing me Late Flightly!
negative,@SouthwestAir Thank you.  Twitter says I can't DM someone unless they follow me.  Can @SouthwestAir follows my twitter?
negative,@JetBlue - why does my TSA-pre work with every airline BUT you? I pay good money for that. Spent 30 mins on phone to fix to zero success.
negative,@AmericanAir How is it possible that your call system can refuse callers for over twelve hours? What service options does that leave?
negative,@USAirways I will NEVER travel US Airways again. Flew in from LA to DC last night and for the 2nd time on this airline my bags didn't arrive
negative,@AmericanAir unfriendly unhelpful agents. Unannounced gate changes. Delayed flight that we found out about by word of mouth
negative,"@USAirways Just discovered that they billed us $300 for the rescheduled flight, which cost me a second day of lost work."
negative,@SouthwestAir too long to wait for bags when they could have been on the next flight out. The party of 4 could have waited in Albany
negative,@USAirways has completely wasted my work day! Thank you for the bad service and bad Friday!
negative,"@united I will do delayed baggage claim when I land. Hopefully the bag isn't broken into, damaged or lost w/c will result in more complaints"
negative,@AmericanAir you're running 5+ hours behind replying to anyone via Twitter. this is beyond unacceptable. I'm running out of time!
negative,@AmericanAir I've been trying to call your reservations desk for past 12 hours and can't get through.  This is not what I expected.
negative,"@united keeps delaying my flight, horrible customer service"

negative,@united can you get me on the delayed flight to EWR out of YYZ at 15:30? No customer service to be found in airport
negative,@AmericanAir pretty frustrating when you can't even stay on hold to get help after a flight Cancelled Flightation!
negative,"@united although, I am stranded in Chicago O'Hare for another 8 hours. Any chance your cracker-jack service team could provide a meal?"
negative,@united can u get the crew member that we are waiting on? We were told 40 minutes ago they landed here and they are still not to our gate.
negative,"@AmericanAir i tried all day. Have been disconnected due to ""heavy call volume."""
negative,@USAirways you can't control the weather but you can control customer service. Without luggage for 24 hours &amp; still yet to speak to a human.
negative,@united  Thanks for nothing! No Atlanta Lounge? Your Ap says NO. Sure nothing at Terminal T http://t.co/tFjfMSHa2k
negative,"@united my flight landed 50 min, but we are being told to stay on the plane, haven't pulled up to the gate &amp; have little to no information."
negative,@USAirways No speciifc email. 1500 character limit for complaints. Is AA/US customer complaints adopting the twitter model?
negative,@USAirways @jtrexsocial 5 hours on hold ... Safe to say no one is working .
negative,@united Please msg me a # for customer service. I will have an invoice for my dry cleaning but won't be able take wet clothes to the airport
negative,"@VirginAmerica Is it me, or is your website down?  BTW, your new website isn't a great user experience.  Time for another redesign."
negative,"@AmericanAir why can't you hire a staff that is helpful, informed and nice to it's customers?"
negative,@united Just checking in again - what is the status of our claim.   It is going on 2 months with no attention to this?   We are very upset.
negative,"@united Nope. Walked up &amp; down the ORF terminal, &amp; not a United agent to be found. Showed up @ last minute to board us. Many panicked people"
negative,"@USAirways stranded @Ernie_Vigil Phoenix w/ broken foot.  Both my flights f'd, Sunday for ""sickcrew"".  Cancelled Flighted my mechanics flight today."
negative,@USAirways nope not yet...
negative,"@SouthwestAir promised 4 rooms until Wednesday, (wentook3) and the hotel charged us $79 per room because we had a pink paper needed white?"
negative,@AmericanAir my flight has been delayed &amp; I can't talk reach anyone in customer service because of high call volume.
negative,@USAirways 2 hours and counting. ..what kind of travel voucher do I get for this??
negative,@USAirways after pleading with car service to stay 3 hrs. past pick up they left me and my family but it's ok i have water and crackers!
negative,@AmericanAir Flight 2559 it's been delayed every hour since 8:55 am.
negative,@AmericanAir back in UK now no thanks to your staff that wouldn't me or the other passengers stranded. Just laughed at us
negative,@JetBlue everyone is here but our pilots are no where to be found and my last flight the plane was dirty that I had to clean my area &amp; seat!
negative,@JetBlue flying to Denver March 1st and my flight itenary keeps getting changed what the heck...booked the trip 3 months ago
negative,@VirginAmerica  how are you gonna have a deal from Dallas to DC but no deal from DC to Dallas? #sad
negative,@USAirways now you don't know where my luggage is?  Seriously?
negative,@AmericanAir TSA said there is nothing they could do. But the question is why are your employee's swapping your customers belongings?
negative,"@USAirways  I open the credit card and earn 44,000+ miles, and you wont' credit the miles to my account to restore the forfeited miles"
negative,"@USAirways how about an update? 2hrs delayed, this obviously isnt up 2 date, havent boarded http://t.co/L7lWjaZiOA"
negative,@SouthwestAir Report was filed but would like to support some active searching.  Feels pretty passive now.  Info on computer is precious.
negative,@AmericanAir can u help rebook passenger via Twitter/DM.  Been on hold for 1.5 hours. Thanks!
negative,@JetBlue I think it's safe to say that after 25 years of loyal #JetBlue flying we are officially DONE. #Byebyejetblue
negative,@USAirways thanks but the bags are only 10% of what went wrong. 22 hours from DCA to SAN when there were no weather issues is not acceptable
negative,"@USAirways Literally all that says is ""Case open""  What good is that to me?"
negative,@united - could you please send me a phone # to the refunds department?  We have submitted our claim through email without success.
negative,@AmericanAir yes. Shows Cancelled Flightled &amp; asks for her to contact you at 800 number.
negative,@SouthwestAir A-List Pref credit card holder called exclusive # and hung up after on hold for 14 min. What gives???
negative,@USAirways this is ridiculous #planebroken can't wait to board this one home 5 hours Late Flightr #neverontime #brutal #paymytab
negative,@AmericanAir you need to have a look at your handling of flight 106 and 104. Company of yours size should have protocols in place to help
negative,"@united it's frustrating, as a frequent flyer, loyal since Continental. Upgrade equals paying 3 times or more on top of purchase ticket."
negative,@JetBlue #489. Flight #589 is departing before we even board
negative,@SouthwestAir needs to train their employees to be at lease somewhat empathetic when THEY lose our luggage.  Monika at MWA needs a PR lesson
negative,@AmericanAir has no customer service via phone or in person. Just a stone wall with a giant middle finger painted on it.
negative,@SouthwestAir Southwest is scheduled to fly to Costa Rica on March 7 but I can't book it online. When will this be available?
negative,@USAirways You won't give us a hotel or food. Can you at least suggestion options for making it to the metro city I have a ticket to?
negative,@united I'm not booked on a 1:30 return flight..
negative,@SouthwestAir Been on hold 34 min so far trying to book seat for my infant. Price increased $42 in meantime. What do I do?
negative,@united So what does someone with severe anxiety do when the one person who can help him isn't next to him?
negative,@USAirways US 728/Feb 21. Ground power shorts again for the third time. Weary German passenger deplanes. Makes me jealous. Auf wiedersehen!
negative,@united it is too Late Flight for reFlight Booking Problems now - it is morning already and I no longer need a hotel room
negative,@united I like delays less than you because I'm the one on the plane. Connect me with a voucher
negative,@SouthwestAir on brd now.frustrated we go 2 #BUF not #ROC.if tld flt was gng 2b held earlier would not be a mess.cng bk unable due to overbk
negative,"@USAirways We did. @AmericanAir said to open one with you, too."
negative,@JetBlue @KyleJudah I just spoke to the baggage claim center and they gave me travel credit but will not be responsible for the cost of a
negative,@united Was just hung up on by customer service after waiting 30 min on hold...guess that vacation's not happening? Website wasn't working.
negative,@SouthwestAir the last 4 times I've arrived @LASairport our gate has been blocked by a slow to depart plane leading to 30-60 min delays
negative,@SouthwestAir here's a first..both pilot and first officer in galley during flight...
negative,@AmericanAir I've been on hold ANOTHER hour and still nothing. My Cancelled Flighted flight was supposed to be six hours from now. #Stranded
negative,@AmericanAir another day another grievance with this airline. No customer service
negative,@USAirways you guys should be nice and just give your routes to jet blue and southwest.  At least they treat their customers properly.
negative,@SouthwestAir  this is really unhelpful. Why can't I rebook online? http://t.co/N5O43sVl8i
negative,@AmericanAir I can't keep dialing you guys all day. Can I get into the callback queue?
negative,@united couldn't have possibly messed up our trip anymore than they did. Thanks for being such a terrible airline. #disappointed
negative,@united This has been the WORST flight experience I've ever had. Thank you for ending my vacation on such a bad note.
negative,@united Maybe be hiring your own ground staff at LAX when multiple gate agents tell you your baggage is loaded you expect it to be. HOPELESS
negative,"@AmericanAir @sa_craig no, not helped one bit. actually ended up driving home due to extreme disorganization and lack of communication."
negative,"@JetBlue if there is a ""processing error"" the  why do you send out full flight tickets and confirmations? #FlySouthwest"
negative,@AmericanAir they were no where to be found at Midnight Last Night! I would think the agent in LAX could have relayed that info.Bag on flt
negative,"@SouthwestAir sucks. Passengers leaving the plane to make room luggage, checking luggage and getting back on. Delayed flights to same city."
negative,@JetBlue They told us 10 minutes almost 40 minutes ago.
negative,"@AmericanAir really? That's it? Not even a ""we are looking into this to see what happened/what we could do better next time"""
negative,@united Why do I pay more for Coach Plus to be told preboarding that all overhead bins will be full for me
negative,@united of course I would like hepl! Are you kidding me? That's the ONLY reason I've been on hold for the past 5 hours!
negative,@united that's why I missed my flight. If the flight had been held for 5 minutes I would have made it. I watched it pull away from the gate
negative,@SouthwestAir I am going to stop flying with you.  Delays everytime.  This time due to paperwork?
negative,@USAirways on hold now over 2 hrs on one phone hung on 5 x on another? How do you reach a person? No weather condition makes this excusable!
negative,@AmericanAir an hour now waiting on the phone for US Air help. 10 hours waiting at the airport yesterday. Love the service guys.
negative,@AmericanAir not anymore.
negative,@united thank you for your reply.  My frustration is that spending a upgrade just puts you on a wait  list.
negative,@united is the worst airlines sitting on the plane at  Houston-bush airport now for an hour and a half waiting for Late Flight passengers
negative,@SouthwestAir can you answer the phone so I can change my flight plans. Srsly.
negative,"@united flight Cancelled Flightled,  and the updated one gets me into BWI too Late Flight! I'd be fine with DCA or IAD,  just arriving earlier!  Help!"
negative,@USAirways is a joke. Stop losing my luggage!
negative,@AmericanAir extremely upset that your baggage handlers decide to go in my luggage and take my belongings
negative,@SouthwestAir needs 2 make me whole Used my tkt back n PHX due 2 rude SNA agent Jacquie Plitt flew @USAirways 2 CABO http://t.co/QxWW1p09a0
negative,"@AmericanAir  when do you anticipate decisions for Cancelled Flightlations at DFW tomorrow morning? Need to rearrange hotel reservations, etc. ASAP!"
negative,@united Yes my flight was rebooked. I'm just losing trust in you if I want to get anywhere on time.
negative,@USAirways wonder if this misery is considered a damage in a breach of contract lawsuit #lawyerup
negative,@SouthwestAir and now no wifi??? Come on.
negative,@USAirways not yet. But we will see shortly.
negative,@USAirways doesn't seem likely bc your team failed to scan my bag in LAX and you recycle bagtag numbers that doesn't help #usairwaysfail
negative,@united it's been over 3 hours...at what point do you let people off of the plane? @FoxNews @CNN @msnbc
negative,@USAirways on hold 2.5 hrs trying to reschedule our flight. Can anyone there please help us?
negative,@SouthwestAir I'm gonna ignore the fasten seatbelt sign and I want to see if ur man enough to do anything about it!!!
negative,@USAirways what's up with flight 5545 no gate agent or plane at PHX B18?  Nice customer service.
negative,@SouthwestAir #tfw1 @JimCramer @AARP TY-Spent total of 3 hrs and 20 mins holding. Cell battery died. Finally made arrangements w kind Rep
negative,"@JetBlue okay. Names of SJ crew are Alamo, Tatiana. Keep telling me to hold, then leave desk. Ali told me he couldn't help bc going on break"
negative,@AmericanAir no; I just expect a higher level of customer service &amp; for the flight crews to give us accurate information
negative,"@united as if a 4 hour maintenance delay wasn't enuf, u charge me $25/bag as a global service platinum mbr. Get ur shit together"
negative,"@united thanks for the link, now finally arrived in Brussels, 9 h after schedule..."
negative,@united Monday evening.
negative,"@united no commitment to a good turnaround, an operations mgr would have counted a dozen small issues with individual performance"
negative,"@JetBlue You have very unhappy customer. After waiting 20 min on hold, rude &amp; uncaring rep has now frozen my acct. can't print bdng pass!"
negative,@JetBlue 👍. I think I'll come take a nap at the terminal.  ;)
negative,@JetBlue @DatingRev mco to lag two hour delay and sitting in Tarmac going on 40 minutes with infants crying on plane!! Get us off this plane
negative,"@USAirways guys I need help my reservations, tried calling and I'm told to call Late Flightr. Please help me here."
negative,@AmericanAir  zoom in on the sauce and potatoes.  This stuff is vile.  And I mean vile. http://t.co/m2PHoavRxC
negative,@united updated A320 aircraft has wifi and device entertainment but no outlets. I don't get it. How can I charge devices?
negative,"@united, we've been waiting for over an hour for our luggage- what gives?"
negative,".@united Really? Was bumped down from Gold status, asked to pay $$ to keep it, and get fewer miles... How is that worth it?"
negative,@united then send your Jeff Smisek on a trip with JetBlue or SW and make sure he takes notes. I would never choose to fly United again.
negative,@USAirways if you could have ran your USExpress/PSA worth a damn I wouldn't be stuck in horrible CLT now.
negative,"@SouthwestAir have you considered adding the ""we'll call you back when we have someone free"" feature to your support line?"
negative,"@AmericanAir 
It's not what happens to us that matters...It's our response that matters. Way to drop the ball AA."
negative,@AmericanAir my flight is Cancelled Flightled and we can only call in but you aren't accepting calls? How do I reschedule my flight?
negative,@USAirways US 728. One water run of the planet's smallest water bottles. Applaud you looking out for the environment.
negative,"@united I'm not sure how you can help. Your flight experience is terrible, planes are dirty and staff is rude. Start over perhaps?"
negative,@SouthwestAir Apparently mechanics had to be flown in to fix some planes...not the most assuring sign
negative,"@VirginAmerica
wjere is our luggage #so slow at lax"
negative,"@JetBlue I put it my ""to"" and ""from"" airports, click update and it tells me to put in my ""to"" and ""from"" airports."

negative,"@usairways and @AmericanAir  4 days of Cancelled Flightations, I have driven to 3 airports in 3 different states, spent more on gas than my flight."
negative,@united Apparently they are asking 20 people to off board the plane--how can such a big miscalculation be made?!
negative,"@united worst AIRLINE 
BEWARE THEY DO NOT MAINTAIN THERE PLAIN 
BEEN ON THE RUNWAY THE PAST 4 HOURS!!!/"

negative,@USAirways yay for glitchy tracking system!  My bags made it to my destination and not Laguardia like the app said!
negative,@AmericanAir you guys need to educate your employees on what a pink tag is AND STOP LOSING MY GUITAR FOR THE 10 THOUSANDTH TIME!

negative,@AmericanAir I have tried to talk to someone for almost 6 hrs! you Cancelled Flightled my flight and you won't pick up the phone. pathetic &amp; very sad

negative,@USAirways I left an item on plane BOS-PHL on Friday.  I've called PHL US Airways # &amp; left 6 msgs. No return call what to do at this point.
negative,@USAirways will you please update your website with the most current flight status? And update your customer service phone # on @google thx
negative,@AmericanAir @Stone9956 Do you dislike delays when they're caused by YOUR crew forgetting to load bags &amp; lazy pilot wanting duty day to end?
negative,@united can you not get the first flight of the day off the ground on time?   #1531.  Let's go.......
negative,@united The bright side would be keeping the promise that was made to me. Hope you're having a good night. Thanks.
negative,@AmericanAir you ever wonder why you find yourselves responding to so many customer complaints on twitter? It's because your airline sucks.
negative,"@AmericanAir yes, and rebooked incorrectly."
negative,"@AmericanAir That's good, I'd expect that but I can't get through on the phone to make any changes. Can I change it online?"
negative,"@united don't need your apologies, need my bag. Took 56 minutes from landing to get it. Unacceptable."
negative,@SouthwestAir why was flight 4199 out of Boston tmrw @ 1230 Cancelled Flightled?
negative,"@united, and now while waiting for new pilot the door on plane BROKE. why am I global services status  on an airline that's unsafe? STUNNING"
negative,@USAirways checked into my flight yesterday and have been bumped to a Tuesday flight! Unacceptable and no agents to speak to!
negative,@united that's not an apology. Say it.
negative,@SouthwestAir when will you be accepting reservations past August 7?
negative,"@JetBlue is JFK still closed? Tryna get out of Ft Lauderdale on flight 502, just want to get home to nyc!"
negative,@USAirways Can you help me update KTN on the profile?  Ticket book via AA &amp; that info didn't get pass on.  I've been on hold forever
negative,@AmericanAir TY Can you confirm or deny if AA953 left JFK? I want to figure out if more delays are in store. Internet giving different info.
negative,@AmericanAir you Cancelled Flightled my flight tomorrow (without telling me) and I want to rebook-please help me book a new flight! What # can I call?
negative,@united what exactly do you hang on this hook? http://t.co/ZHxOk07Aqa
negative,@united I sure did.   I had to drive a total of 3 hours to get my own bag.  I'd like to explain that debacle but no one wants to talk to me.
negative,@AmericanAir I can't work with them if the call gets cut off while I'm still holding..... Is DFW looking any better tomorrow?
negative,@JetBlue still waiting for bags from flight 26. It landed an hour ago.
negative,"@AmericanAir you think I haven't tried that multiple times?? The ""status"" of my bag is that it should've been here YESTERDAY. So disgusted."
negative,@SouthwestAir I am absolutely sick of 300s and no wifi!
negative,@united Yes I needed plenty of assistance but received none.
negative,@USAirways @caterobbie if that link worked most of us could take care of ourselves  please contact your tech people to get that working
negative,@AmericanAir 3611 was supposed to depart at 5:10pm central.  About ready to close the door at 7:34pm central.
negative,"@united I've sent the message, let me know if you got it. I'm not very twitter-literate. Also, is he REALLY going to be stuck for 18hrs?"
negative,@AmericanAir I DMed you my AA &amp; phone #s &amp; you can't have someone call me? What was the point of your response? You didn't resolve anything!
negative,@united about 3 hours ago. I need to work out if my bag can make it to my hotel here in time or if it will need to go elsewhere.
negative,@united Did somebody say flight upgrade?
negative,@SouthwestAir do you ever reinstate Cancelled Flighted flights?
negative,@united mobile apps need construction from the ground up for each OS category.  It's expensive to get right .
negative,@united a plane took our gate and now we're just waiting in a lot at DIA
negative,@AmericanAir change fee = same price of new ticket... Not logical
negative,@JetBlue I don't believe so. That's not what the team has told us.
negative,@USAirways My Flight Booking Problems C68LD9 just times out when I select it under Manage My Flight Booking Problems for months now. I have emailed but no response. Help?
negative,"@united according to your DMs, I'm not owed a refund. please may I be provided with a contact number before I go to my bank to file claim"
negative,"@USAirways the least comforting thing from your pilot after sitting on a stationary plane for 3 hours is ""I don't really know what happened"""
negative,"@united - handed a slip of paper,&amp;said to call 1800#. Have called 2x/day trying to get it sent, still @ layover airport.Have that ref # tho."
negative,"@VirginAmerica lost my luggage 4 days ago on flight VX 112 from LAX to IAD &amp; I'm calling every day, no response.Please give me back my stuff"
negative,"@AmericanAir Disappointing lack of kindness toward this person. The agent asked her counterparts ""why this person was talking to her""."
negative,@united they helped me at the baggage service desk.  Said bc TSA screening was down in FLL not all bags made it but bag will be in EWR @ 12
negative,@united so is the ^JJ standing for Just Joking?  I am not finding the humor.
negative,@united Flight:UA1750 is basically a prison on the runway @ SFO 6delays 4hrs of sitting no water no answers. reminded y I hate this airline
negative,@USAirways This is ridiculous. You delayed my husband's flights &amp; made him miss his connection. Told him to leave his bags. Sent him (1/3)
negative,@USAirways @AmericanAir Flight SF to NYC only made it to Philly. Ur customer service is telling me no refund for the last leg? #offensive
negative,@AmericanAir I really hope it departs. They said is because the catering service wasnt available but we can see it next to plane doing nthin
negative,@SouthwestAir looks like my 1 yr anni trip has been replaced w someone's itinerary. Worried abt who can c my flight http://t.co/BApE6RuMNE
negative,"@united your website is fucked up. Now instead of a $416 flight I should’ve had yesterday, it’s $514 today. Thanks."
negative,@united Not sure what you are talking about. She is going on nonstop flights. SNA to SFO and then SFO to EWR.
negative,@USAirways is really good at deferring responsibility.
negative,@USAirways Get new planes then. Got on this plane at 7:50 its 10:20 now and still on tarmac. How ru going to compensate me for this?
negative,@USAirways providing poor customer service by responding to complaints with a copy and paste tempLate Flight unreLate Flightd to complaint #usairwaysfail
negative,@USAirways @Forsyth_Factor hope for no weather delays no help to reroute and your on your own for lodging non stop is the way to go
negative,@AmericanAir so you fail again flight to rdu sitting waiting on flight attendants. your logistics are not good
negative,@VirginAmerica called your service line and was hung up on. This is awesome. #sarcasm
negative,@USAirways over an hour is unacceptable wait time. thanks for nothing.  Be sure never to fly you again
negative,@USAirways freaking out about the fact you are fixing the engine from Charlotte to Orlando. #longday
negative,@USAirways Why is there no contact email for customer complaints?
negative,"@SouthwestAir Redeem-points packages magically gone by time we finally got through @ 10:01, felt like #baitandswitch"
negative,@united thanks for ruining my wedding anniversary. Flight UA4904 from EWR to RDU is delayed by over 3 hours and will reach home the nxt day
negative,@united i did but i got nothing from it. Just dissapointment =(
negative,"@AmericanAir I need to be at work tomorrow at 8am, therefore that doesn't help.  Direct message faster than calling 800 number? #Backwards"
negative,@united on flight 1665 but it's not departing! Website says delayed due to operational difficulties-what does that mean?
negative,@united U kept passengers waiting all night 4 a plane that was being put out of service.  Leaving everyone stranded for night. #inexcusable
negative,@JetBlue no excuse though for 3 gate changes though.
negative,@USAirways this made me have to Cancelled Flight my car reservation and it came out to more money...why did you reschedule a time without the crew?
negative,"@USAirways @AmericanAir @GMA could not have had a worse airline experience. Rude, unhelpful, got yelled at😳. @JetBlue need your help"
negative,@united with Karen and found her unhelpful and rude  called United at the time &amp; told she could board but Karen would not accept
negative,"@USAirways Well, that's a problem considering I need to book a flight tonight for this weekend... is there anything you can do?"
negative,@AmericanAir @elwoodblues77 I'm sure he understands the rules but you guys just have zero customer service. Staff your damn counters!
negative,@AmericanAir  we are going to the police dept due to the sexual assult that your stewardess allowed to occur and your lack of concern
negative,@AmericanAir thx for showing me that your Twitter appreciates me more than your employees. Sure another airline would like my $1300 #nohotel
negative,@JetBlue I'm sick of y'all.
negative,"@USAirways yep, check it and my gmail 'Promotions' folder regularly... :-("
negative,@JetBlue flight 790 you had us stuck on the plane for nearly 4 hrs. Set to take off only for flight control to deny us. THE WORST SERVICE
negative,@united bad idea to let 200 people back on the terminal with food vouchers but allow only 15 minutes to get anything.  Long lines!! #ua1523
negative,@AmericanAir  flight to dca I need to change asap help can't get through
negative,"@USAirways your CSR in PHL suck.   Flt 3883 gets cx'd,  i get rebooked to the next day?  On standby for 4011. Not hopeful."
negative,@SouthwestAir How many trees have to die before you stop trying to sell us a credit  card? #OptOut http://t.co/CXrZhcdTVz
negative,"@USAirways I'm not patient. I'm annoyed. If you can't book this travel online, then you shouldn't make people wait on the phone."
negative,@AmericanAir work would be much better with my lesson plans and music for my classes today.
negative,@united Thanks.    This one was delayed an hour and a half prior to scheduled departure.
negative,@USAirways @husainhaqqani Mr. Husain u shld protest as well when one of ur party member Rehman Malik delayed a PIA flight for hours..???
negative,@united that may be true however after 4 weeks matter is still unresolved and I can not get through to a supervisor or manager to help
negative,@AmericanAir Still waiting news about my bags 48hrs already happened and this company don't give to the passengers any certain information
negative,@united if your air traffic crew could get their shit together no one would notice the rudeness of the ground staff
negative,@united anyone awake? Paying for wifi on iPhone when need to be using it on laptop. Logout option for wifi in flight? Time is wasting!
negative,@JetBlue's CEO battles to appease passengers and Wall Street - Waterbury Republican American http://t.co/Ur60Un86gy
negative,@USAirways I waited on hold for too long. I shouldn't have to wait on hold forever when I never received a confirm. in the 1st place #help
negative,"@AmericanAir no one received text alerts, automated calls, anything either. Literally no information as to what was happening."

negative,@USAirways @jtrexsocial i fell asleep from a call i placed midght.. guess what still on hold 7 am
negative,@USAirways gate agent in CLT forced me to check bag in z1 &amp; proceeded to allow larger bags. Huge inconvenience to travel plans.
negative,@united there is a disconnect between your PR group and the actual business strategy and employee attitude on the ground.  #liars #united
negative,"@united It isnt simple issue, generally how you set up check in/baggage policies at Logan and general unhelpfulness of employees in early AM"
negative,@USAirways need to retrain US 3837 lead flight attendant and gate agent at arrival MKE 2/23.  Horrible attitudes toward helping customers.
negative,@united so we fly into SFO and Honululu gets pushed back 3.5 hours and now it looks like more delays.  I beg of you plz sort this out soon!
negative,@JetBlue and they are telling me I got to get another hotel and food...so spend more money because you guys made me miss my connection

negative,@USAirways and no offers to provide us with a hotel or anything for a flight that is over 19 hours away!
negative,"@united not 100% sure, however my ticket included one checked bag, therefore this charge was extra and completely unanticipated."
negative,@AmericanAir you cxl both my flights to/from DFW to CLL w/o notice then treat me like trash on the phone and offer no compensation? WTH?
negative,@SouthwestAir @PoteetTJ had to fly @Delta MCO-&gt;CMH for $400 b/c we cldnt reach SWA to reroute SWA 3104 Cancelled Flightlation. Voucher wld help.

negative,"@JetBlue hey awesome peeps, what's up with flight 1159 from Boston? Delayed 3hrs?"
negative,1/2 @united Just be honest with your customers. The new seats are designed to fit more rows on the plane. More rows = more money.
negative,@AmericanAir 24 hrs &amp; 2 cncld flights Late Flightr I've landed in PHL. Now 30 mins &amp; counting on tarmac waiting for gate. Pls do better than this.
negative,@JetBlue it's ok. Things happen. Just very frustrated when you have to change your schedule. See you tomorrow for a new rescheduled flight.
negative,@JetBlue won't see my money again after their poor service    should have stuck with virgin america what was i thinking trying jetblue???
negative,@united so disgusted and disappointed with united airlines luggage policies and attitude toward musicians. Unacceptable
negative,"@AmericanAir  so far all I am getting is ""maybe your bag will come today. We don't know."" Website says ""status unknown""- can you help?"
negative,@USAirways I've been on hold for over 2 1/2 hours - there has to be an easier way to Cancelled Flight/get a refund... 😑😩 http://t.co/Cm4roIypc2
negative,@AmericanAir sure is. What's more frustrating is being stranded at the airport with our fate in your hands.
negative,@AmericanAir I'm not sure what happened to my USAirways status when the merger took place.
negative,@USAirways I've been on hold for 41min. Just trying to change my reservation.

negative,@AmericanAir got off the phone w/ rep now flight has disappeared. Locator IRRLCD she said I was rescheduled. Help please.

negative,@USAirways testing my patience this evening (or shall I say morning?). We waited an hour at the gate for you to find a gate agent.  130am
negative,@USAirways we should have been given the option to get off the plane not sit on it for a time longer than our actually flight.
negative,@united flight was Cancelled Flighted after the last opportunity to rebook us on other flights this evening passed.
negative,@SouthwestAir while you clearly didn't care about our troubles yday thought I'd share bags took &gt;90min and came back absolutely drenched..
negative,@USAirways i dont need to check status of my flight because i was ON the plane and you had a door malfunction. Get it together!!
negative,@JetBlue just lost my business   Enjoy your profits
negative,"@AmericanAir she was rude, unprofessional,  not helpful in helping me try and get home. As a #aaadvantage #loyal aa customer dissatisfied!"

negative,"@united please explain why I need to pay bag fees twice, equally $1200, because a delayed flight resulted in bags being rechecked overnight?"
negative,@united yes there is when you keep getting the same robotic answer.
negative,@USAirways you reminded me today why I fly @SouthwestAir
negative,@JetBlue Only wish your ground operation was as expedient as your Twitter response team! Delay just got extended!
negative,@SouthwestAir I did ....it's just been such a disheartening experience for me and my family...and a lot of taxi money wasted.

negative,@AmericanAir @andyellwood @delk lol. I was sure I'd wake up to more of a response than this half-thought auto tweet. hope you made it out.
negative,@united does asap mean two hours worth of delay and a return to the terminal to count the luggage a third time? #gottogetbetter
negative,@USAirways Thanks for the info but have been trying for over 24hrs and no luck. Flight dep. Today. Need 2 change 2 tomorrow or Thursday

negative,"@united also during the run I was instructed to do, I shattered my computer. http://t.co/oAflfr7WXB"
negative,@AmericanAir it's not about the delay.  It's about the communication.
negative,"@SouthwestAir Lastly, for a company that's trying to put the love in flying it would be nice to have someone personally address my concerns."
negative,"@AmericanAir that's unacceptable. They should allow me to wait on hold, or take my number and call me themselves."
negative,@JetBlue that is my point! They are only offering me a flight the next day and expect me to now pay for a hotel because they Cancelled Flightled.
negative,"@SouthwestAir horrible experience, passenger of size was 1/3 in my seat, offered $50 voucher for this by Christine C http://t.co/1xzrK66wVQ"

negative,"@AmericanAir while listening to a delay message on my phone, another delay message was coming in. Get your shit together!"

negative,@united day 3 of this Saga maybe they'll finally make it home.Intentional or not it not gonna get them back there vacation days #badservice
negative,@United What idiot designed your seats? Armrest TV remote &amp; resting elbows don't mix. Seatmate keeps changing channels &amp; blasting volume.
negative,@AmericanAir Sorry that is a sad answer a fully refundable first fare and no response in 6 weeks ! No more AA in my future !
negative,@USAirways just hung up on me again.  Another waste of an hour of my time.  How am I supposed to book a one way award flight?  #badwebsite

negative,@JetBlue thanks for making me miss an important dinner tonight. 2 hr delay and now 20 min on Tarmac... #worst
negative,@SouthwestAir you know I ❤️you but trying my patience - had easier cheaper ways from TPA to PDX but stuck w u. Turned my 3 hrs in MCI to 6
negative,@AmericanAir How can I get a flight change while in the air? Delays causing a missed connection again. There is 1 seat for Late Flightr
negative,@united my last call your customer service agent called me back... As he was stuck on hold to air Canada.. Just hope he's booked me a flight
negative,@AmericanAir so I have to call back at 9 since the department is closed. This has to be the biggest bunch of bull!
negative,"@USAirways US 728 returned to gate to get ""MEL"" sticker. Oh, look. We heard from pilot! No clue what an MEL sticker is. Anyone?"

negative,@AmericanAir But you called me - and hung up.
negative,"@JetBlue yes, please get me the seats we paid for."
negative,@VirginAmerica you're the best!! Whenever I (begrudgingly) use any other airline I'm delayed and Late Flight :(
negative,@southwestair on flight 3130 and I paid $8 for wifi that can't load a website functionally except for your own live streaming. Unacceptable.
negative,@united why? So I can waste more of time on this airline to get an automated message? Disappointing as always.
negative,@AmericanAir just messaged you. Please have someone contact us immediately.
negative,@USAirways would love it if you could get my wife home sometime soon - she has been stuck in Orlando and now stuck in philly for too long

negative,@united currently crying... I wanted to ski tomorrow but prolly not. Just a boy tryna fulfill his dreams
negative,@AmericanAir don't worry you won't steal my money again
negative,@jetblue any idea where the plane for flight 672 is coming from? I thought flight 305 from JFK but that wouldn't explain delay.
negative,@JetBlue I've been in pricing for 8 years to know that 70 bucks a seat is criminal. 20-30 I understand. #pricing #flying #jetblue #pricewise
negative,"@JetBlue we tried. They're not at all helpful. Terrible customer service, at this airport, at least."
negative,@AmericanAir still not taking calls ?   Storm ended 2 days ago. Be like pats and #doyourjob
negative,@USAirways what am I paying you $275 for?   Fly the damn plane!  Not one announcement from the crew.  Let me know how you wanna refund me.
negative,@AmericanAir You didn't respond to my DM. You tweeted the same canned tweet you're telling everyone else.
negative,"@united flt 4567 no gate agent, no announcements. So unprofessional. Time to go back to @Delta"
negative,"@united you need to retrain your flight attendants. Saying there is no more room for carry ons when there actually is, is not cool."
negative,@SouthwestAir #flight #Cancelled Flightled...tried to get refund but on hold. Can I get it after my flight would have departed?
negative,@JetBlue - He Cancelled Flightled a flight &amp; was given 2 weeks to apply travel bank credit to another flight &amp; credit was transferable
negative,"@AmericanAir that 2 hr wait became a 4 hr one. And y'all claimed to have sent an email. Yeah, that never happened. #FlyDelta"
negative,"@USAirways i have and you have not been able to locate them, its insane. i trust you and PAY you to look after my things and you lost them."
negative,@united error message said couldn't process request at the last step after seat selection on each leg. Agent was unaware of an (1 of 2)
negative,@USAirways I spent more on the room &amp; transportation then I did the whole flight
negative,@AmericanAir You have the worst customer service of any airlines I've ever encountered. Flat out awful
negative,"@united Awesome flight crew on UA1589, re the plane,  the  Jurassic period called and they want their dinosaur/plane back!"
negative,@SouthwestAir  when you take my money and do not provide a service makes for a profitable venture for your company. #IsItTheGaryKellyWay?
negative,Really? 9+hours???? @united: @JenniferWalshPR We don't like delays and do all we can to avoid them. We'll have you on your way ASAP
negative,"@JetBlue Yep, still waiting for bags at #JFK. What's the holdup? Looks like we are the only flight that got in at this time..??"

negative,@SouthwestAir you could be a little more accommodating with extending my flight credit.Whats 10 extra days!#notahappytraveler
negative,@AmericanAir pathetic to have your gate agents lie to my face when you are at fault
negative,@USAirways I have to fly back to Charlotte out of a different airport. You guys are not very flexible like other airlines.
negative,@JetBlue I've heard your new in flight tap to pay readers accept ONLY Apple Pay. I thought that was impossible &amp; certainly not EMV compliant
negative,"@united Not until tomorrow night. And the hotel voucher had higher rate than travelocity Not loving cost, but hard working staff"
negative,@USAirways Ever sit on hold and just lose track of time? http://t.co/Yqhk8LJaBN

negative,@AmericanAir hey there me again from yesterday im still on hold
negative,"@USAirways They charged me for a flight they Cancelled Flightled, unbelievable and unheard of"

negative,@SouthwestAir You guys are just being disrespectful at this point... learned my lesson about this airline
negative,@united waiting for flight 4567 to memphis. Incredibly rude gate agent waited until after departure time to announce delay. (1 of 2) #rude

negative,@USAirways your people are kind and hardworking the infrastructure you have given them is horrid #massivefail #failphone #fail

negative,@SouthwestAir I spoke to soon... My bag was lost.. :(
negative,@united space. Doctors' notes and everything. And on my first trip they lost my first suitcase. Among other issues- not pleased with #united
negative,@USAirways been sitting at gate for over 25 min on us 728! What gives???
negative,"@united lost my parents luggage to cancun, said it would be delivered to hotel by 7PM, it is now almost 11PM"
negative,"@SouthwestAir now we have to wait, and wait to get it straight. I fly you for personal and business. But now, not so sure. #BeBetter"
negative,@JetBlue didn't find them unfortunately :( but he was very helpful and took down my info incase they do get found
negative,@AmericanAir that's absolutely horrible customer service. The person supposed to call me can't immediately call back when disconnected???
negative,"@United is an airline where you pay extra to get a better seat but by the time you board your overbooked flight, there's no overhead space."
negative,@USAirways your phone system is not working at all I have been bumped again so now I am at 3 times I need to get out of mco
negative,@united As a Million Miler I've been delayed plenty. NEVER in the amateurish way@SilverAirwsys does it. I'd be embarrassed to be affiliated.
negative,@usairways Seriously. This is ridiculous. I shouldn't have to wait a hour for my luggage after I land. #wtf
negative,@AmericanAir Cancelled Flighted our flight and now are still delayed...NOT COOL.
negative,@SouthwestAir I'm a huge fan and give y'all too much business...so please fix the damn wifi!

negative,@USAirways I have been on three planes for flight 1907 and still haven't left the ground BAD SERVICE #sad
negative,@SouthwestAir I already follow you and can't DM because u need to follow me back
negative,@SouthwestAir Finally got through after 3 hours and all set. Thanks.
negative,@united No. Denver said they don't handle baggage that made it to Colo. Springs.  They gave me an 800 number to call. No help there either.
negative,"@AmericanAir To announce DURING BOARDING that you chose to limit catering to the point that you WILL run out shows a lack of planning, IMO."
negative,"2/2 @united You don't really care about our comfort, you care about profitability. That's fine, just own up to it. #unfriendlyskies"
negative,@united been on hold for almost two hours trying to talk to someone about a Cancelled Flighted flight tomorrow morning. What do you suggest?
negative,"@USAirways Your ""moveup"" policy really sucks. United has a 24 hour policy for this with status. I was wanting to move up from 5am to 7am..."
negative,@AmericanAir why can't @dfwairport have the capability to spread salt on a runway?!
negative,@USAirways is flt 680 en route to DCA or BWI after diverting to RDU. Your phone service  sucks and your website is conflicting.
negative,@united then why have I not received my call back its been 3 days...it's an infant car seat how am I supposed to go anywhere with my child
negative,@USAirways I have never been given a number for elite for usair. Only AA. I waited for 3 hours for an answer and by then my seat was gone.
negative,"@united Nope, no more chances. Your airline messed up both ways of our trip."
negative,@AmericanAir Can't help now as all seats have been taken.  There has to be a way to handle high volume of call days.
negative,@united a rapid trip plane ticket from Idaho to California that doesn't have problems would be wonderful
negative,"@AmericanAir AA1675 flight out of Jamaica was Cancelled Flightled yesterday due to ""weather"", while other flights were still landing at DFW"
negative,@USAirways Now the next plane had a broken seat!  My row!  Another hour delay!  #mad
negative,@united thanks I'll fill out the form that no one reads or responds to.
negative,@united Stuck in IAD going on 6 hours waiting for a ferry flight from Nashville that u can't tell when it will arrive?!! Ridiculous!!
negative,@united still waiting 4 our bags. Web STILL can't tell me its location . How come @UPS @FedEx can tell u at any given minute where it is?
negative,"@united - well, now finally on board hopefully we take off this time and quickly. Well over an hour delay!!"
negative,"@united, American never had my bags apparently. United never switched them over. Had to go back to United Baggage Service."
negative,@USAirways attendants at the gate. Enjoyed watching the other flight to our destination take off before having a horrible attendant give us
negative,@AmericanAir I know.  After an hour I got a live person.  It messes up our arrival and car plans at two airports and is costing us more.
negative,@USAirways and I can't get through on any phones
negative,@AmericanAir so we have a Cancelled Flightled flight in about twelve hours. Maybe we'll have heard from an AA rep at that point.
negative,@AmericanAir Got it worked out. Had to postpone my trip and pay extra though. :/ Not easy for a poor graduate student.
negative,"@USAirways 
Not one to complain much but really 1 hour 15minutes and still nothing. Agents or Agent ⤵ http://t.co/Q5SB0DaVuy"
negative,@AmericanAir I'm willing to hold for an agent. you aren't being helpful you keep hanging up on me #americanairsucks #hiremorepoeple
negative,@united please provide update on UA 791. This flight has been stranded by united with no information from the crew on the plane.
negative,@AmericanAir you could train your flight attendants to have some manners and decency
negative,@USAirways Really a letter that says you will discuss serving drunks more drinks that doesn't help the current situation
negative,"@USAirways flights &amp; ""customer relations"" are extremely disappointing. Faced too many problems to type. apology=$25 towards a flight. A JOKE"
negative,@VirginAmerica hold times at call center are a bit much
negative,@AmericanAir you have such a confusing web site/complicated ordering process. This is why I typically fly @SouthwestAir.
negative,@USAirways waiting for bags now over 25min in Phl bag claim!
negative,@AmericanAir Or u cud answer my ? here! 140 is plenty. Inflight stealing going on right now &amp; FA won't have the uncomfortable convo w pass.

negative,@AmericanAir flight 3056 in D/FW now delayed 2 hours waiting sitting in plane for baggage to be loaded - why?
negative,@united YOU GUYS ARE HORRIBLE.
negative,"@AmericanAir your gate agents at DFW gate B16 are pathetic tonight.  Terrible communication, stories changing and apathetic"
negative,@AmericanAir has to be the worst airline in the world #yousuck #horrible #Oscars2015
negative,"@USAirways will do.  maybe the pre-purchase meal email is because the flight is 9 min short of 3 hours, so I guess there are none offered"
negative,"@united thanks for a terrible experience at EWR. Customers should be treated as a priority, not as an inconvenience #tryagain"
negative,"@USAirways the two women workng PHL bag check term C @ 11:30 ET should be fired for being rude, pushy and treating customers with disrespect"
negative,talked to a @JetBlue manager and she offered we pay 3X's in cash what we originally paid #nothanks #jetblue #ripoff #flyunited
negative,@USAirways 24 hrs of traveling and this just welcomes u back home to the US. 4 hr layover and I get to watch it going to wrong destination.
negative,@united thanks kp but luckily my transfer has maintenance issues and is still delayed so I didn't miss my transfer...
negative,"@AmericanAir -- This is after you Cancelled Flightled our flight into Buffalo because of ""weather"" and lied to us and said other airlines Cancelled Flightled"

negative,@united I get that. But doing it by giving inaccurate/misleading info doesn't seem like a great way to do it. #hopethegearmakesitintact
negative,@united It is all good -- your 1K team has been nothing short of amazing with everything.
negative,@united yes. We waited in line for almost an hour to do so. Some passengers just left not wanting to wait past 1am.
negative,@united maybe one day you'll be the one quoted on http://t.co/mJkpgVXmPC
negative,@USAirways 8 hrs of wait time is unbelieavle unaccpetable biggest airline in the world should have failback call centers
negative,@USAirways really nigga.. Ur a fuck boy
negative,@USAirways stuck on the runway for 2 hrs 10 min due to weather in PHL. Nowhere can I find accurate info on #558 to BOS
negative,@USAirways I have been calling for 3 days!

negative,"@AmericanAir I need help with a reservation purchased on @AmericanAir but operated on @USAirways, can't get through on the 800#"
negative,@USAirways @AmericanAir  worst customer service ever how can you let people be assaulted on your flights and do nothing about it
negative,@AmericanAir why would I bother wasting my time calling them when they are gunna do nothing
negative,"@united if guy on flight 1230 follows through on threat to sue because he couldn’t carry on 3 bags, I will defend you for free."

negative,"@united hi JH. Yes please. Since I lost almost a whole day on the way out, could you help me change my return for one day Late Flightr?"
negative,"@JetBlue All correct for rates Boston to Pittsburgh wknd March 14? Rates all of a sudden took off! Made plans, came back to buy &amp; surprised."
negative,@JetBlue I understand why ur doing it. But for someone who just traveled 2+ hours to get here early. Relax b4 flight etc. Adv notice maybe??
negative,@united flight UA3364 been sitting on tarmac for 30 mins with no report as to why...any input?
negative,@united I have to go back home! I have to use what the company has available. But it's unfair to stay more than 24 h traveling
negative,@AmericanAir Thanks. Took care of it. Issue was IVR was unclear and took too long to get a call-back option. Would love to see that fixed.
negative,@JetBlue @TatianaKing @thewayoftheid I feel only a few free travel vouchers will assuage my indignation.
negative,@AmericanAir I have a Cancelled Flighted flight tomorrow morning and the 800 number did nothing! Please! I just want to go home!
negative,@USAirways and after six hours even the gate agent got fed up and left us all on line in front of an empty desk. Stay classy US Air.
negative,@USAirways i did and i'm not stupid. i've done web development for 19 yrs. the issue (now confirmed by your support) is YOUR website.

negative,"@united I was insulted, disrespected and met with incompetence at every turn how about a voucher for a domestic round trip"
negative,@AmericanAir it was my friend. She shouldn't have been scheduled so close together at LAX then not reimbursed. It's costing her 12 hrs &amp;$250
negative,@united #bullying in the #workforce not ok. Get gate agents 2 work as a team. 2 against 1 is never cool. #Delays #flights #UnitedAirlines

negative,"Hey @USAirways based on the number of retweets and likes on my FB post, it's nice to know I'm not alone in my frustrations with you guys!"
negative,@USAirways. R U aware your wait time to talk to a sales agent is always 30-60 minutes? Unacceptable. At least employ a call back feature!
negative,"@united I was rebooked, however it would have been nice not to have to wait an extra 90 min at the airport.  How will you make this right?"
negative,@SouthwestAir can you tell me why you Cancelled Flightled the flight vs delay

negative,@united lost my bags and there was a flight from Chi to Eri that landed over 1.5 hrs ago...yet still have zero updates?? #UnitedAirlinesSux
negative,@united website says my flight is on time. It leaves in 15 min and nobody has boarded yet. #pathetic #needtobehonest

negative,Hey @AmericanAir why automated call me and then hang up at 4:45 am!?! And why can't I reschedule Cancelled Flighted flights via web!?! Come on!!!
negative,@united sucks.
negative,"@united 1st u delay my flight for mechanical failure,then 2 hrs on the runway, &amp; 13 hrs Late Flightr I'm still here with a lost bag &amp; no resolution"
negative,@AmericanAir this is the biggest joke I've ever seen and will be telling everyone never to use you guys cause you are a joke

negative,@VirginAmerica there is something wrong with you website in Safari iPhone
negative,@USAirways you can send my luggage to my house👋

negative,@united airlines is the absolute worst. They have no idea what they are doing. #neveragain #UnitedAirlines
negative,@AmericanAir I was happy to purchase the upgrade. If only it was avail on my next flight.
negative,@united you really do have a culture problem. Everyone I tried to work with blamed someone else or told me how they're short staffed
negative,"@AmericanAir Understood. Integration takes time, but no excuse for poor customer service"
